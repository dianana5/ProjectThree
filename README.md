# Unbound Children
Project Two - Diana Torres


# Project Statement

I personally choose this cause because I was a little girl once. I can’t imagine how it must feel to have your innocence and childhood be stripped away from you. I became aware of this issue when I was on Titkok. It became prevalent to me that this topic isn't talked about enough. When I shared this to my friends and classmates, many were not aware that this still goes on in the world.  A definition by Unicef says, “Child marriage refers to any formal marriage or informal union between a child under the age of 18 and an adult or another child.” The Unbound Children Festival is to raise awareness about child marriages that still happen around the world. The festival, held in Harvard University on December 8th, 9th and 10th. I have added events of survivor stories, a candlelight vigil, and a community art show to engage attendees to support this cause.
