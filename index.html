        <h1>Unbound Children Festival</h1>

        <p> is dedicated to raising awareness about the fight to end child marriage. 
            It highlights inspiring events designed to engage and unite the community in advocacy and action.
             Just to highlight a couple of events that you will find throughout the festival. 
             You will hear Survivors Stories. This will include brave speakers that chose to share their testimonies of strength and resilience. Along with that the Community Art Show. On the last day, a Candlelight Vigil which offers a solemn gathering to honor victims and affirm solidarity in the cause. 
            We hope this festival encourages you to share what you will learn with others who are not aware of what is going on.

        <h2>What is Child Marriage?</h2>


        <p> Child marriage is kids who get married (usually) forcefully under the age of 18. 
            This practice violates human rights and disproportionately affects girls. 
            It can limit their education, put at risk their health, and future opportunities. 
            Child marriage may occur anywhere in the world but it is most prevalent in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. However, it also still exists in some states here in the United States. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Some reasons on why Child Marriage still exists: <br> 
            <strong>Poverty: </strong> families may view marriage as a way to cover financial burdens, like selling away their daughter. <br>
            <strong> Gender Inequality: </strong> some countries that prioritize male education and employment over females. <br>
            <strong>Lack of Education:</strong> limited access to education leaves girls vulnerable to early marriage as families prioritize marriage over schooling. <br>
